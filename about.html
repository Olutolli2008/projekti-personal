        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Staring at a blank page with the cursor blinking at you can be intimidating.
        I understand. I write for a living.
        And for some reason, it gets even harder when you try to write about yourself. That's probably why there are so many bad About Us pages out there. They’re soulless and don't say much. If you were to swap out the name of the company, they could easily apply to just about any business.
        
        Why write something if you don't want to say anything? A prospective customer only clicks on your About page because they want to learn more about the company or the founders. So let's give the people what they want! 

        Why do you need an About page? Well, “need” is a strong word. If you don't have one, it certainly won’t tank your restaurant. But there are some benefits to an “About Us” page.

        First, it's an opportunity to humanize your restaurant and tell your story. Think of it this way: if the Menu page is the “what” you do, and the Contact page is the “where” you do it, the About Us page is the “who” and “why.” It's a chance to create a human connection with your online audience. Why not take advantage of it? 

        Second, it's extra content to add to your website. Search engines like content. It makes them happy. So if you can write a few hundred extra words in an About Us page, it may give your SEO a little boost.</p>
